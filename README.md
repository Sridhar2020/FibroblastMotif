# FibroblastMotif
Code to generate data for the different Myocyte-FibroblastMotifs

Folders Steep and Shallow contain sub-folders for each of the three coupled Fibroblast-Myocyte motifs for parameters Steep and Shallow in the TP06 model.

For each motif, the programs simulates 4 pacing periods (T=300,400,500,600), 3 Delays ( tau = 0, 10, 25 ms) and 9 values of G_loc (strong) and G_Long (weak) conductance values.

To run the programs first run MakeFolder.py followed by Run_script.py

The programs here are for the case where the Fibroblasts have a resting membrane potential of -24.5 mV. 

Note that some of the files are common across the different folders.
